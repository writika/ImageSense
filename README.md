# ImageSense
Create a deep learning model to generate image captions with an attention mechanism using the Flickr8K. The project combines CNN and RNN models for effective caption generation. dataset. 
This model, designed for the visually impaired, converts captions to speech, helping users understand images through audio descriptions.
